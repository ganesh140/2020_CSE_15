# API for Document Resizing, Validation and Verification.

  Technology has enabled us to upload and submit documents online at ease with computers, mobile phones, etc. With this service there also comes the hassle of monitoring, adjusting size and dimensions of the document images(jpeg and png) and the clarity of the content in images requested by the websites. This service will help the website developers and the user to receive and upload images respectively without having to monitor the size(memory) and dimensions of images.
  
  This report proposes an API which on integration can be used by website developers for their website to resize images according to the size and/or dimensions of their requirement and verify the validity and authenticity of content in images. The version of the Web API that will be developed will provide validation and verification for Aadhaar card, PAN card and Driving License. Further updates might include the implementation of verification of more documents. Keywords: Web API, Resize, OCR, Validation, Verification.
